[Mar 2022] Joining UCInspire research program hosted by University of California, Irvine, under instruction of [Prof.Ian G. Harris](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/), with research topic in Textual Entailment of Natural Language Processing.  

[Feb 2022] Joining SAIC Foundation Tongji Joint Intelligent Driving Project Research Team in Tongji University to conduct computer vision application in autonomous driving, responsible for high-precision semantic segmentation research on road surface features such as lane lines and zebra crossings, under supervision of [Prof. Chao Wang](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1154/9075.htm).  

[Aug 2021] Completed Data 8 course on remote summer session at UC Berkeley and obtained Grade A in the class, where I finished an 8-week course and two data analysis project regarding genetic science and semantic natural language processing respectively.

# Experience 
## Research Experience

### Tongji University
**SITP(Student Innovation Training Program)**  
*Need Predication of Sharing Bicycle based on LSTM Neural Network/Research*, Member  
Oct 2019 - Mar 2021  
- Optimized the structure and parameters of the model based on time and space features with accuracy improvement from 60% to 80%+  
- Classified datasets combining with interdisciplinary research methods (e.g. biological methods)  
- Defined regional criterion including the 1000m-radius area centering on metro stations, malls and schools  
- Applied principles in counting from hemacytometry to the marginal data-set point  

**SAIC Foundation Tongji Joint Intelligent Driving Project Research Team**  
Research Assistant  
Feb 2022 - present  
- Responsible for high-precision semantic segmentation research on road surface features such as lane lines and zebra crossings;  
- Combining the latest work and research in the field to improve the model, propose and verify a suitable detection and segmentation scheme.  

### University of California, Irvine   
Research Intern, Remote,  
Mar 2022 - Jun 2022
 -  Reviewed a number of papers related to texutal entailment and studied on Repurposing Entailment for Multi-Hop Question Answering Tasks——Multee, which is a general architecture that can effectively use entailment models for multi-hop QA tasks, and:
      + reproduced results in the paper; 
      + attempted to add named entity annotations using Stanza(a NLP tool from Stanford) to OpenbookQA dataset, and used the annotated dataset to fine-tune the multee model, yet got slightly poorer metrics, which might due to the insufficiency of annotated words(tokens);
      + studied on ESIM(Enhanced LSTM for Natural Language Inference) and developed the idea of merging Multee and ESIM; 
  - Started analysis on the parse tree templates and:
      + tried tagging the subject and object, parse tree and dependency relations using Stanford CoreNLP tool;
      + studied on parse tree structures under Penn Tree Bank annotations and tried to delevop workable parse tree and dependency templates for predicate calculus and first-order inference system, having referred to some previous work;
      + trying to implement ideas on the OpenbookQA dataset.

## Professional Experience
### Ping’an Securities, Shanghai
Jul 2021 - Aug 2021
